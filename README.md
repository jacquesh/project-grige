Project GrIGE
=============
Project GrIGE is my "Greatly Improved Game Engine", the successor to an attempt that I made a couple years back at writing a simple Java game engine.
Hopefully this one turns out to be actually useful.  
It is very much a work in progress.

Currently Supported Functionality
---------------------------------
* Rendering of any reasonable number of textured sprites
* Basic 2D lighting, with hard shadows (still to be improved, but it works)
* Simultaneous playing of multiple audio sources
* Keyboard and mouse input polling
* Easy camera movement
* Object Selection/Picking based on screen position
* Basic text rendering
* Sprite animation (using SpriteSheetPacker)

Yet-to-be-implemented Functionality
-----------------------------------
* Sprite normal mapping (because pretteh lights)
* Sprite self-illumination maps
* Directional lights
* Spotlights
* UI elements (buttons/text fields etc)
* Basic particles
* Proper logging (there are currently some rare crashes)
* Pixel-perfect collision detection
* Basic multiplayer/network support
